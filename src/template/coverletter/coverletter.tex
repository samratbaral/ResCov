% First Paragraph: Introduction------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\FirstParagraph}{\firstrelevanttechnology hey had no proof. He knew that they knew he had done it but they
 didn't have any proof. It was a huge distinction and it was the difference between him keeping his freedom or
 being locked away for decades. They continued to question him, probing him for information that they could use
 against him or find the proof they needed to put him away. He smiled and continued to block their every inquiry by
 feigning his innocence for a crime they all knew he committed}

% Second Paragraph: Experience and Skills---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\SecondParagraph}{\secondrelevanttechnology Where do they get a random paragraph?" he wondered as he clicked the generate button.
Do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere? At that moment he read the random paragraph and
realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same. With six children in tow, Catherine
raced to the airport departing gate. This wasn't an easy task as the children had other priorities than to get to
the gate. She knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled at the kids to keep up.
They continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed them down. They
had no idea the wrath they were about to receive when Catherine made it to the gate only to be informed that
they had all missed the plane. }
% Third Paragraph: Job Interest---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\ThirdParagraph}{\thirdrelevanttechnology According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah Chapter of the
 Daughters of the American Revolution on May 12, 1939, â€œCollege Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for
 Educational purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout
  the world in all the learned professions.}
% Fourth Paragraph: Reachout and Closer-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\FourthParagraph}{ It was a simple green chair. There was nothing extraordinary
 about it or so it seemed. It was the type of chair one would pass without even noticing it was there, let alone what
 the actual color of it was. It was due to this common and unassuming appearance that few people actually stopped to
 sit in it and discover its magical powers. }
